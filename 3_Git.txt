 First we need to make a file as a git repo or we can say git type so we can use git commands.
 
  > git  init => use to make a folder as a git repo
  > git clone link => make a existing project as a git repo in your local machine
 
 > ls => saw us list of folders
 > git status => what are changess happened and are they in stage area or not
 > git diff filename.fileext => show us what change happened in a particular file
 
 Now we need to push changes in git so first need to make all changes in staging area them cimmit the changes
 
 > git add filename.fileext / git add -A => for make all changes in staging
 > git commit -m "messege" => commit all changes
 > git log =>what are the commits happened (git log -3 // show us last three logs)
 > git show gitcommitid => show us what change happened in a particular commit
 
 
 Now lets talk about branches
> git branch => show us all branches
> git branch branchname =>build new branch
> git branch branchname => go to that branch
> git branch -d branchname => delete a branch
> git merge branchname => that branchname branch will merged to your current branch

> git reset --hard =>remove commit and code 
> git reset --soft => remove only commit

Now lets push all data to your local to github
> git push
Same like that from github to our local we will do
> git pull

# Each job run on a different new machine 
# jobs will run parallely until we use -> Need 
# in steps is shell program then no need to use ${{...variable...}}, like in if conditions
# artifacts for creted in one job that can use in another job
# cache -> in a single workflow for each push/worflow, so like first push cache created and in 2nd or 3rd the cache used
# secrets can be written in github repo settings -> Like docker credentials for uploda image in docker hub

# 🔰 Core → Advanced GitHub Actions Topics
# Workflow & Control
# 1. workflow_dispatch (inputs, manual triggers)
# 2. schedule (cron jobs)
# 3. concurrency (cancel previous runs)
# 4. permissions (GITHUB_TOKEN scopes)

# Conditions & Expressions
#1. if expressions (job-level vs step-level)
#2. continue-on-error
#3. always(), success(), failure()
#4. Contexts (github, env, runner, matrix)

# Environment & Secrets
#1. env (workflow / job / step scope)
#2. Environments (staging, production)
#3. Environment-level secrets & approvals
#4. Masking secrets in logs

# Jobs & Architecture
#1. Reusable workflows (workflow_call)
#2. Composite actions
#3. Custom GitHub Actions (JS / Docker)
#4. Job outputs (outputs)

# CI Quality
#1. Linting pipelines (ESLint, Prettier)
#2. Test reports & coverage artifacts
#3. Status badges
#4. PR checks & required checks

# Deployment & Release
#1. Tag-based workflows (v*)
#2. Release automation
#3. Blue-green / staged deploys
#4. Rollback strategies

# Docker & Infra
#1. Docker build & push
#2. Docker layer caching
#3. Self-hosted runners
#4. Kubernetes deploy via Actions

# Monorepo & Scale
#1. Path-based workflows (paths, paths-ignore)
#2. Monorepo selective jobs
#3. Large matrix optimization
#4. Cost & runtime optimization
